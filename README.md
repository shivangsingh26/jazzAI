# jazzAI

This is a Python-based music generation application that uses the `facebook/music-small` model from Hugging Face and the Audiocraft library by MetaAI to generate music based on user input. The user interface is built with Streamlit, allowing users to input a MIDI file and select a time duration for the music generation. The generated music can be listened to and downloaded directly from the application. The project also includes a package check feature to ensure smooth operation.
